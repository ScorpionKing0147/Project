# Titanic Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook containing a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset. The aim of this analysis is to explore survival rates among passengers and identify key factors that contributed to survival during the tragedy.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Cleaning**: Steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis to understand the data better through visualizations and statistics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques used to create new features that improve model predictions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of survival.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
